# sphp
PHP Switcher script on SUSE

# Introduce
I made this script because I need it. I really hope so that any feature version will be part of SUSE Linux.

# How to use
Manually download PHP versions and copy in right directories (with this we do not need compile anything)
Just run script in bash

# Plan for the feature
- Change original PHP RPM files as part of the SUSE Linux to be able install many different version of the PHP in the same Linux environment.
- Upgrade script to check versions, paths and so on
- Add script in one RPM installation package as part of SUSE Linux
